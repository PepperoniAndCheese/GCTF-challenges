10/9/2017:	Learning how to code php! I have some HTML knowledge after my WCD teacher's constant preaching about going to w3schools.

11/9/2017:	Alright! My senior said that vim is far superior to nano. Time to test that out!

12/9/2017:	Going back to nano editor. I'm too dumb for vi, but I won't tell my senior that.

13/9/2017:	Nano is best editor obviously... I can code in php and it has nice colours!

15/9/2017:	My laptop battery spoilt and those stingy companies only gave 1 year warranty on that. Someone accidentally tripped over my wire and my screen blacked out. Thanks a lot!

22/9/2017:	Finished the first php prototype of my program!

23/9/2017:	Just need to figure out how to read files and maybe a password... Who knows?

25/9/2017:	I have a working page now. Amazing! I should tell all my friends about it. Hopefully, they will save the environment too!
